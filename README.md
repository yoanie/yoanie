## Hello, wanderer! Warm welcomes to my profile! 👋
I'm currently a Computer Systems Engineering student trying to dabble in new and interesting things that I come across! When it comes to my projects, I like to breathe a lot of life into the things that I do. As a result, some of these projects will take a little time to come out, but I'll do my best to make it as good as I can! I want to explore everything related to computers, but out of everything, I am most interested in creating optimized algorithms, interconnected systems that make up a program's engine, as well as homelabbing! If anything about what I do interests you or if you would like to collaborate on anything based on my existing portfolio, please contact me at clawdancestudios@gmail.com! I'd love to chat about anything that interests you!

## **Current Undertaking: [Wikibot](https://github.com/yoanie/wikibot)**
Wikibot is a for-fun Discord bot aiming to bring the world of Wikipedia (and the Wikimedia Foundation) right into your server. Planned to come with many fun things, such as a daily article, an in-text channel way to read anything that interests you, and potentially even some games! Will be coded entirely within Python using the Wikipedia API.

Past interesting projects:
- [Snurder Game](https://github.com/yoanie/snailgame) | A Gamemaker project about a human's imminent demise. My first real, hands-on experience working with version control alongside other programmers!
