## Hi there 👋

## **Current Initiative: [Snurder Game](https://github.com/yoanie/snailgame)**
Snurder Game is a side GameMaker project made in GameMaker's own programming language. Collaborating with [OneRandomProgrammer](https://github.com/OneRandomProgrammer), this project tests my branch knowledge and gives me real project working experience!
